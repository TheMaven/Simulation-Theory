1.	You realize you are in an actual simulation: you are the only actual being.  Everyone else is game created content.  What would you do? How would you react?  
	a.	You wake up and a supposedly inanimate object talks to you? (Eg: a tree)
	b.	The tree reveals that you are actually in a simulation.  The tree is your guide, it isn’t meant to talk to you, but has decided to help you.
	c.	Goal is to get out of the simulation.
	d.	He has only been in the simulation for a short amount of time(eg 1 week).  But he feels he has lived a life of 30 years in there.
	e.	Open world in the sense there are a multiple storylines which allow you to do things .
	f.	Main story line is where the tree gives you tasks that will combine to allow you to escape the simulation that you are trapped in.

2.	Details:
	a.	Tasks will be relatively simple and linear.
	b.	The beginning and the end will be the most important parts.  The middle will just be simple yet quirky tasks to allow you to get to the end.
	c.	The reason you are doing the tasks, is so you can change the code in the simulation to give yourself abilities.
	d.	Yet acquire an ability to change gravity so you can jump higher for tasks.  Example task: Jump up a stairway of floating blocks and roll a sphere off so that it hits a target, to acquire another ability.

3.	Platform : PC


Gameplay: 
	•	Tree gives you roughly 5 tasks
	•	There are roughly half a dozen other npcs that can give you one or two tasks.


Main story:
	•	Fetch an object that you return to the tree, which gives the tree the ability to change the code to help you.
	•	Search for scripts that combined will give you the ability to temporarily change gravity in the simulation.
	•	Use the ability to change gravity to jump up a series of blocks that are in the sky.  On the top block is a sphere(Respawning) which you have to push off so it hits a bullseye target, dead on.
	•	Maze with moving objects, you use the slowed down time to slow down the moving objects to navigate through them.
	•	Blocked cave, which you use the destruction ability to enter.


Scripts:
•	Dialogue.
•	Interaction.
•	Movement.
•	Each ability will need its own script; abilities include: altered gravity/super jump.  Slowed down time.  Destructive ability. (Toggles within interaction/movement scripts).
•	Maze w/ moving objects.


Texture:
•	Mountain
•	Waterways
•	Forrest – with pathways
•	House – where the player wakes up.


NPCS:
•	Only tree, every other object acts like it is a real world object.  (But you can over hear every now and then inanimate objects talking.)  May be difficult as it will have be text based.


Delegation:
•	Movement script – what we have now
•	Interaction script – what we have no w/ minor mods.
•	Dialogue – mod what we have now.
•	

We all need to do ui and script stuff.

ENDING: You wake up in another world and start walking around.  A tree talks to you again.
